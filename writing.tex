\begin{enumerate}

  \item We first \textbf{decided on} an inventory of semantic relations. \cite{semeval}

  \item We \textbf{accept as} relation arguments only noun
phrases with common-noun heads. \cite{semeval}

  \item This \textbf{distinguishes} our task \textbf{from} much work in Information Extraction, which tends to focus on specific classes of named entities and on considerably more fine-grained relations than we do. \cite{semeval}
  
  \item We also \textbf{impose} a syntactic locality requirement on example candidates, \textbf{thus excluding} instances where the relation arguments occur in separate sentential clauses. \cite{semeval}


\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {It speaks to the success of} the exercise that the participating systems’ performance was \textbf{generally high, well over an order of magnitude above} random guessing. \cite{semeval}
  
  \item The best relation (presumably the easiest
  to classify) is CE, \textbf{far ahead of} ED and MC. \cite{semeval}
  \end{enumerate}
\section{Sentence-init}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{It speaks to the success of} the exercise that the participating systems’ performance was {generally high, well over an order of magnitude above} random guessing. \cite{semeval}
